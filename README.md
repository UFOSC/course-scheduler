# Course Scheduler

A dynamic course scheduler for planning out college semesters.

## Goals

Course planner that can suggest a sequence of courses based on constraints such as:

1. Core / Compulsory Courses
2. Individual Interests
3. Credit / Ease of Completion (i.e. Easy Grades vs. Learning Value)
4. More to Come!
