# Course Scheduler

A dynamic course scheduler for planning out college semesters.

## Goals

Course planner that can suggest a sequence of courses based on constraints such as:

1. Core / compulsory courses
2. Individual interest
3. Credit / ease of completion (i.e. easy grades vs. net learning value)
4. & more (suggest stuff on our [issues](https://github.com/ufosc/course-scheduler/issues) page!)
